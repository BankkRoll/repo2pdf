     - add line numbers in the PDF
     - add page numbers in the PDF
     - add highlighting in the PDF
     - remove comments from the code
     - remove empty lines from the code
     - one file or one PDF per file
   - Name of the output PDF file or output directory

## Configuration

repo2pdf automatically ignores certain file types and directories (e.g., `.png`, `.git`).
To customize the files and directories to ignore, you can add a `repo2pdf.ignore` file to the root of your repository.

Please note that if you use a local repository, the `repo2pdf.ignore` file must be in the root of the repository directory. And you might need to add more directories to the ignore list, as the script does not automatically ignores different build files and directories.

### Example of file structure

```json
{
  "ignoredFiles": ["tsconfig.json", "dist", "node_modules"],
  "ignoredExtensions": [".raw"]
}
```
