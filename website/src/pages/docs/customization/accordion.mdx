This section provides a quick start guide for the accordion component.

### Accordion

The Accordion component allows you to create collapsible sections. It's useful for presenting FAQs or other information that can be expanded or collapsed.

<Accordion
  items={[
    {
      title: "Is it accessible?",
      content: "Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern.",
    },
    {
      title: "Is it customizable?",
      content: "Yes. You can customize the styles as you like.",
    },
  ]}
/>

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>;
}
